I am currently a graduate student in Computer Science at the [University of Oregon](https://scds.uoregon.edu/cs).

I previously worked on machine translation between Korean and Korean Sign Language at [EQ4ALL](https://www.eq4all.co.kr) in Seoul, South Korea, where I led R&D for automatic translation, collaborated with native signers to guide and validate our work, and worked on reducing bias in data collection and model validation.

I am currently working on several small projects related to model validation and error-corrected correlation.

If you have similar research interests, let me know! I would love to collaborate.
