I work on machine translation between Korean and Korean Sign Language at [EQ4ALL](https://www.eq4all.co.kr) in Seoul, South Korea.
Sign language translation and production are interesting because they draw on computer vision and NLP and require a different view of language.

I believe most problems benefit from human insight and that design decisions should be deliberate.
This means interviewing domain experts and users, selecting meaningful features, and understanding our data and models.
I value drawing from known relationships for feature engineering or expressing them as as mathematical models to inform our model.

My current research interests are:

- Machine Translation
- Pose and Gesture Modeling
- Dynamical Systems
- Multi-Task Grounding for Language-Capable Agents

If you have similar research interests, let me know! I would love to collaborate.
